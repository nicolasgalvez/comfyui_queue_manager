The frontend is a React project built with Vite and run by bun (can use npm too).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Gotchas
### Frontend in development mode vs production mode
Coding front end in development mode (with `npm run dev`) is faster thanks to fast reloads.
In queue-manager.js set variable QM_ENVIRONMENT to `development` to enable dev mode source of the react app iframe.


#### Cross-Origin issues
When running the front end in development mode, you will run into CORS issues when trying to access the ComfyUI APIs.
Since dev mode frontend and comfyui are running on different URLs, you will run into CORS issues.
To fix this run ComfyUI with the `--enable-cors-header http://localhost:3000` (or whatever post URL / port you gonna use) param (allowing dev mode front end to request comfyui apis) i.e.:

```
python main.py --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 8188 --enable-cors-header http://localhost:3000
```

## Delete confirmation regression test

```sh
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
npm run build
npm test
```

The browser test runs the built frontend on a temporary localhost port and
intercepts every backend request. It checks Cancel and Confirm for individual,
running, gallery, bulk, and filtered deletions without contacting ComfyUI.
